Firehole is a set of proxies used for vulnerability simulation. Each proxy will stand between the client and the server and wait for the client connection. Once it was established, it will keep both connections separate. Each request is logged, and can be modified or completely discarded. In some cases even communication side channels (FTP's EPSV mode) are monitored.

The setup should be as simple as specifying the proxy address, app address, and the vulnerabilities you would like to simulate.
